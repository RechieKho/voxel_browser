# Contributing to Voxel Browser

Thanks for looking at the code. This doc is the practical "how do I work in
this repo" reference — for *what's designed* see `ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`,
for *what's left to build* see `REMAINING_TASKS.md`, and for *gotchas,
landmines, and past investigations* see `STATE.md`. Read `STATE.md` before
touching anything networking-, threading-, or dependency-related — several
subtle bugs have already been found and fixed there, and re-discovering them
wastes time.

## Module map

The engine is split into two static libraries plus three executables
(`CMakeLists.txt` §top comment has the one-line version of this):

| Target                 | What                                                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `vb_core`               | Engine core. No rendering, no window — must build and run headless. |
| `vb_render`              | Client-only rendering (raylib + raygui). Never linked by the server. |
| `voxel_browser`          | The client ("the browser") executable — `src/client/main.cpp`. |
| `voxel_browser_server`   | The authoritative, headless server executable — `src/server/main.cpp`. |
| `vb_tests`               | Unit + integration tests (doctest) — `tests/unit/*.cpp`.       |

`vb_core` is assembled from per-module subdirectories, each with its own
`src/<module>/CMakeLists.txt` and mirrored `inc/vb/<module>/` headers:

| Module         | Directory                     | Purpose                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `core`         | `src/core/`, `inc/vb/core/`     | Math, `Result<T,E>`/error types, logging, TOML config, ids, generated version header. |
| `protocol`     | `src/protocol/`, `inc/vb/protocol/` | Hand-written wire codecs (`ByteReader`/`ByteWriter`), every message struct. |
| `net`          | `src/net/`, `inc/vb/net/`       | `Transport` abstraction, `LoopbackTransport`/`GnsTransport`, handshake FSMs, `ServerSession`/`ClientSession`. |
| `world`        | `src/world/`, `inc/vb/world/`   | Voxel data model, chunk store, lighting, meshing, block registry, item drops. |
| `worldgen`     | `src/worldgen/`, `inc/vb/worldgen/` | Terrain generation (hand-rolled noise pipeline today; `FastNoise2` is the gated future backend). |
| `physics`      | `src/physics/`, `inc/vb/physics/` | Shared movement + swept-AABB voxel collision (one implementation, server + client prediction both use it). |
| `replication`  | `inc/vb/replication/` (header-only) | Interest-grid culling (hand-rolled; `librg` is the gated future backend). |
| `ecs`          | `inc/vb/ecs/` (header-only)     | Component structs (`Position`, `Inventory`, ...). No registry driving them yet — `ServerSession` still simulates players directly. |
| `assetsync`    | `src/assetsync/`, `inc/vb/assetsync/` | Content-pack manifest hashing + client-side content-addressed cache. |
| `script`       | `src/script/`, `inc/vb/script/` | Embedded Lua VM (`vb::script::Vm`), the server pack API (`PackRuntime`), the client UI VM (`UiRuntime`), the content-pack loader. |
| `render`       | `src/render/`, `inc/vb/render/` | Window/camera, chunk/entity renderers, raygui-backed UI + main menu. `vb_render` only. |

A build without a phase's heavy dependency (`VB_WITH_NET`/`_LUA`/
`_WORLDGEN`/`_COMPRESSION`/`_MESHING`, all default `OFF`) links a stub that
returns a `kDisabled`/`kBackendUnavailable`-shaped error instead of failing
to compile — see any `vm.cpp`/`gns_transport.cpp`-style file for the
pattern. Keep that pattern when adding a new gated dependency: the rest of
the engine, and both binaries, must keep building and running (headless)
with everything off.

## Building and running tests

See `README.md`'s "Getting Started" for the full build-from-scratch steps
and per-dependency system requirements. The short version:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

A few things worth knowing that aren't obvious from a single build tree:

- **Most interesting engine behavior is gated behind `VB_WITH_LUA`.** A
  default build (`VB_WITH_LUA=OFF`) still builds and passes every test, but
  `PackRuntime`/`UiRuntime` compile to no-op stubs — you won't be exercising
  the content-pack/scripting path at all unless you configure with
  `-DVB_WITH_LUA=ON`.
- **Keep more than one build directory around** if you're touching anything
  gated — e.g. one with `VB_WITH_LUA=ON` and one with it `OFF`, rather than
  reconfiguring back and forth. This project's own agent sessions do exactly
  this (see `STATE.md` for examples); it's much faster than a full
  reconfigure+rebuild every time you need to check the other side of a
  `#if VB_WITH_LUA` boundary. `VB_BUILD_CLIENT=OFF` on a Lua-focused tree
  also skips the (slower) raylib build if you're not touching rendering.
- **Run a single test / a subset** with doctest's own filter, not ctest's:
  `./build/vb_tests --test-case='*crafting*'` (glob, not substring — wrap in
  `*...*`; quote it so your shell doesn't glob-expand it first).
- **`server_smoke`/`client_smoke`/`singleplayer_smoke`** (registered in
  `tests/CMakeLists.txt`) start the real binaries with `--headless` and
  assert on stdout/exit behavior — they need `VB_BUILD_SERVER`/
  `VB_BUILD_CLIENT` on (both default `ON`).
- **`content_pack_test.cpp`** loads the real `content/base` files (not
  inline Lua strings) — if you edit that pack, this is the test that
  catches a syntax error or a registration-count regression.

## Code style

- `.clang-format` is checked in — tabs, no column-wrap (`ColumnLimit: 0`),
  run it before committing. CI (`lint.yml`) runs `clang-format --Werror` over
  `src/**`, so an unformatted new file fails CI, not just style review.
  **Caveat:** a locally-installed `clang-format` may disagree with whatever
  version CI's `pip`/`pipx` resolves (see `STATE.md` §4) — if a bare
  `--dry-run` on your edited file shows a wall of unrelated violations,
  diff against the *unmodified* file with the same command before assuming
  your edit is the problem.
- No exceptions on engine hot paths — fallible operations return
  `vb::core::Result<T, E>` (see `inc/vb/core/result.hpp`). Lua-facing code
  (`sol2` bindings) is the one place `sol::error`/exceptions are normal,
  since that's how sol2 reports a Lua-level error.
- Namespaces are `vb::<module>` (`vb::net`, `vb::world`, `vb::script`, ...),
  mirrored 1:1 between `inc/vb/<module>/` and `src/<module>/`.
- Both binaries must stay buildable and runnable `--headless` — CI's smoke
  tests and several integration tests depend on this.

## Adding a new wire message

Every struct in `inc/vb/protocol/` is a normative part of the network
contract. When adding or changing one:

1. Add the struct + `encode`/`decode` (see any existing file in
   `inc/vb/protocol/` for the pattern — `ByteWriter`/`ByteReader`,
   bounds-checked, error-accumulating).
2. Register it in `MessageType` (`inc/vb/protocol/message.hpp`) — values are
   append-only, never renumber or reuse an id once shipped. Assign a `Lane`
   in `lane_for()` if it needs anything other than the reliable-ordered
   control lane.
3. Add a round-trip test in `tests/unit/protocol_test.cpp` (encode → decode,
   assert the fields match) plus a truncation/malformed-input case if the
   struct has anything the existing helpers (`ByteReader`) don't already
   generically cover.
4. **Bump `kEngineProtocolVersion`** in `cmake/version.hpp.in` and add an
   entry to `docs/protocol.md`'s changelog at the top, explaining what
   changed and why — this file is the wire format's source of truth, not a
   changelog nobody reads.
5. If it's consumed by `ServerSession`/`ClientSession`, add or extend an
   integration test over `LoopbackTransport` (see `tests/unit/netcode_test.cpp`
   or `pack_runtime_integration_test.cpp` for the shape: construct a real
   `ServerSession` + `ClientSession` pair, `tick()` both in a loop, assert on
   observable state).

## Working with the Lua content API

`content/base` is the reference pack and the thing every Lua-facing test
loads for real (not inline strings) via `vb::script::load_content_pack`. If
you're adding a new `vb.*`/`ui.*` binding:

- Prefer a **generic, game-agnostic primitive** over something that encodes
  a specific game's rules — the engine is meant to stay a host for
  arbitrary content, not grow special cases for "the base game." A recent
  concrete example: crafting was implemented as a `player:take()` primitive
  (generic, symmetric with the existing `give()`) plus a small
  `load_content_pack` change that lets a pack drop any extra top-level
  `*.lua` module in (also generic) — with every actual game rule (recipes,
  matching, the `/craft` command) living entirely in
  `content/base/crafting.lua`. If you're tempted to add something like
  `vb.craft_item(...)` directly to the engine, ask whether a smaller,
  more general primitive plus content-side logic gets you the same result.
- Document the new binding in `docs/lua-api.md` in the same commit — it's
  meant to stay a complete, example-driven reference, not something that
  drifts behind the code.
- Add a demonstrating example to `content/base` if it's the kind of thing a
  pack author would actually use (see `crafting.lua`'s heavy comments for
  the expected level of explanation — a new contributor should be able to
  read the pack and understand *why*, not just copy *what*).

## Filing issues / picking up work

`REMAINING_TASKS.md` is the live backlog, organized by phase, with `[ ]`/
`[~]`/`[x]` checkboxes and a "Cross-Cutting / Continuous" section for things
that apply everywhere (protocol version discipline, sanitizer coverage,
headless-must-work, etc.). If you start on an item, it's fine to leave its
checkbox as-is until it's actually done — the file's own convention is
"landed and verified," not "started."
