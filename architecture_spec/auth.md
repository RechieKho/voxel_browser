## 1. Idea in one paragraph

A content pack may ship one small file, **`auth.lua`**, that *declares* how
players authenticate: which identity provider (Keycloak, Firebase, any
OpenID Connect issuer…), the client id, scopes, which claim becomes the
player's name, and which claims scripts may see. **If that file exists,
authentication is mandatory**: the engine signs the player in and verifies
the result *during the handshake*, before any pack asset, block registry,
chunk or entity is sent — a player who is not authenticated never sees the
world. Every pack script then gets the verified login data through one
accessor, `player:get_login()`, which returns a table when the server is
authenticating and **`nil` when it is not** (no `auth.lua`). That nil check
is the only thing a script needs:

```lua
vb.on("player_join", function(name, login)
	if login then -- mandatory auth is on, and this player passed it
		-- persist by subject (stable), never by name (display only)
		local profile = vb.db.get("user:" .. login.subject) or { joins = 0 }
		profile.joins = profile.joins + 1
		vb.db.set("user:" .. login.subject, profile)
	end
end)
```

## 2. Goals / non-goals

**Goals**

1. Declarative, pack-owned auth config: one `auth.lua`, no engine flag or
   operator step needed to turn it on. Absent file = today's behavior,
   byte-for-byte.
2. Fail closed. A pack with `auth.lua` never lets an unverified player join,
   including when the build lacks auth support, when `auth.lua` is
   malformed, or when the provider is unreachable.
3. Auth runs **before the world loads**: before `C2S_AssetManifestRequest`,
   so before assets, registry, `S2C_JoinAccept` and chunks.
4. Login data is **verified server-side** (signature + claims) and exposed
   read-only to Lua. The client never decides who it is.
5. Provider-agnostic core (OpenID Connect + JWT), with thin presets for
   common providers (`keycloak`, `firebase`, generic `oidc`).
6. No client secrets anywhere: public-client flows only (PKCE), so `auth.lua`
   is safe to ship in a pack that also gets synced to clients.

**Non-goals (for now)**

- Engine-run username/password databases. Packs that want that keep using
  `vb.db` + `vb.crypto.hash` (the 2026-09-17 approach still works, it just
  is not "mandatory auth").
- Authorization/roles as an engine concept. The engine hands claims to Lua;
  what a `role` claim *means* is the pack's business.
- Pack-customizable login UI. Pack UI scripts are not synced yet at login
  time (auth precedes asset sync), so the sign-in screen is engine-drawn
  (like the 7.1 loading screen) with only text branding from `auth.lua`.
- Token introspection / confidential clients / mTLS-bound tokens.
- An embedded web view. Browser flows use the system browser.

## 3. What exists today (constraints)

| Fact | Where | Consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Handshake already has `S2C_ServerInfo{…, auth_mode}` → `C2S_Auth{player_name, token}` → `S2C_AuthResult{ok, reason}` **before** asset sync | `inc/vb/protocol/handshake.hpp`, `src/net/handshake.cpp` | The slot exists and is in the right place. Auth = filling it in, not reordering the handshake. |
| `AuthMode{kNone=0, kToken=1}`; `kToken` reserved, never verified | `handshake.hpp`, `src/core/config.cpp` (`server.toml auth_mode`) | Add a new value, `kExternal=2`. Leave `kToken` reserved. |
| `HandshakeServerHost::authenticate(name, token) -> AuthOutcome` is synchronous | `inc/vb/net/handshake.hpp` | Verification may need a JWKS fetch (network) → needs an async/pending outcome (§6.3). |
| `PackRuntime::install_join_veto` wraps `authenticate` so `player_join(name)` can veto pre-join | `docs/lua-api.md` | `player_join` gains a second arg, `login`. |
| One global `handshake_timeout_seconds` per connection | `src/net/session.cpp` `system_handshake_timeouts` | A human in a browser needs minutes → per-state timeout for `kAwaitingAuth`. |
| Pack loader runs every root `*.lua` in the pack VM; asset manifest syncs pack files to clients | `src/script/pack_loader.cpp`, `src/assetsync/manifest.cpp` | `auth.lua` must be special-cased: excluded from the pack-VM walk (it runs in its own VM first). Syncing it is harmless (no secrets) but pointless — exclude it too. |
| Deps already present: libcurl (CLI only), nlohmann_json, `vb::core::sha256`, orlp/ed25519 | `cmake/Dependencies.cmake` | Need: HTTPS in client+server (reuse curl), RSA/ECDSA signature verify (new dep, §5.4). |
| Client `kConnecting → kError` path renders `failure_reason()` via `MainMenu::draw_error()` | `src/client/main.cpp`, `src/render/main_menu.cpp` | Auth failures reuse it; a new `AppState::kSigningIn` sits between connect and asset sync. |
| `--singleplayer` runs an integrated server over `LoopbackTransport`, same handshake | `src/net/integrated.cpp` | Same code path → singleplayer with an `auth.lua` pack signs in for real (§7). |

## 4. `auth.lua` — the declaration

Lives at the pack root next to `init.lua`. It is **data, not behavior**: it
runs once at server startup in a fresh, minimal sandboxed VM (no `vb.world`,
no `vb.db`, no events, no `require`, tiny instruction budget) and must
`return` a table:

```lua
-- content/<pack>/auth.lua
return {
	provider     = "keycloak",                 -- "oidc" | "keycloak" | "firebase"
	display_name = "Example Realm",            -- shown on the sign-in screen
	issuer       = "https://id.example.com/realms/game",
	client_id    = "voxel-browser",            -- public client, PKCE, no secret
	scopes       = { "openid", "profile", "email" },
	name_claim   = "preferred_username",       -- becomes the in-game player name
	claims       = { "email", "email_verified", "groups" }, -- exposed to Lua
	max_token_age_seconds = 300,               -- optional, default 300
	reauth_interval_seconds = 900,             -- optional, revocation check (§5.6)
	reauth_grace_seconds    = 120,             -- optional
}
```

```lua
-- Firebase preset: issuer/JWKS derived from project_id
return {
	provider     = "firebase",
	project_id   = "my-game-1234",
	api_key      = "AIza...",                   -- Firebase web API key (public by design)
	sign_in      = { "password", "google" },    -- engine-drawn form / browser flow
	name_claim   = "name",
	claims       = { "email", "email_verified" },
}
```

Rules:

- **Presence ⇒ mandatory.** No `enabled = false` switch; delete the file to
  turn auth off. One way to read the config: is the file there?
- Validated at startup into a C++ `vb::auth::AuthConfig`. Unknown keys,
  wrong types, non-`https` issuer (except `http://127.0.0.1`/`localhost`
  for development), or a missing required key ⇒ **server refuses to start**
  with a precise error. Never silently downgraded to no-auth.
- `server.toml` may **override** deployment-specific values under `[auth]`
  (`issuer`, `client_id`, `project_id`, `api_key`), so one pack works against
  staging and production realms. It cannot *disable* auth for a pack that
  ships `auth.lua`. The single escape hatch is a dev-only
  `--insecure-skip-auth` server flag, compiled out under `VB_DISTRIBUTION`
  (same rule as `VB_WITH_AUTOMATION`) and logged loudly every startup. With
  it, `get_login()` returns `nil`, the same as when no pack declares auth.
- Built without `VB_WITH_AUTH` and the pack has `auth.lua` ⇒ refuse to
  start ("this pack requires authentication; rebuild with VB_WITH_AUTH").
- The legacy `server.toml auth_mode` key: `none` stays the default, `token`
  stays reserved. `auth_mode` on the wire is *derived* from `auth.lua`'s
  presence, not configured.

Provider presets only fill defaults; everything reduces to one internal
shape:

| `provider` | Verification (server) | Sign-in (client) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `oidc` | discovery at `{issuer}/.well-known/openid-configuration` → `jwks_uri`; `iss == issuer`, `aud`/`azp` ∋ `client_id` | Authorization Code + PKCE, loopback redirect (RFC 8252) in the system browser |
| `keycloak` | = `oidc` (Keycloak's realm URL *is* the issuer) | = `oidc` |
| `firebase` | JWKS `https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com`, `iss == https://securetoken.google.com/<project_id>`, `aud == project_id` | `password`: engine-drawn email/password form → Identity Toolkit REST `accounts:signInWithPassword?key=<api_key>`; `google`: browser OIDC with Google, exchanged via `accounts:signInWithIdp` |

## 5. Server side

### 5.1 Startup order

```
parse server.toml/CLI
→ if <pack>/auth.lua: run it in the auth VM → AuthConfig (or exit 1)
→ AuthService::start(config): discovery + JWKS prefetch (background thread;
  failure is logged and retried, not fatal; joins fail closed until a
  key set is loaded)
→ PackRuntime load (auth.lua skipped by the walk) → worldgen → listen
```

### 5.2 Handshake (protocol v29; v28 was taken by S2C_PlayerStatus)

```
Client                                         Server
  │ C2S_Hello                                    │
  │ ───────────────────────────────────────────▶ │
  │          S2C_ServerInfo{…, auth_mode=External}│
  │          S2C_AuthChallenge{provider, display_name,
  │            issuer, client_id, scopes[], params{k:v},
  │            nonce (32 random bytes, b64url)}   │   ← new, only when External
  │ ◀─────────────────────────────────────────── │
  │   … player signs in (browser / form) …        │   server waits in
  │                                               │   kAwaitingAuth, timeout
  │                                               │   auth_timeout_seconds (300)
  │ C2S_Auth{player_name (ignored), token=ID JWT} │
  │ ───────────────────────────────────────────▶ │
  │                         verify (§5.3) — may be │   kVerifyingAuth (pending)
  │                         async on JWKS miss     │
  │          S2C_AuthResult{ok, reason,           │
  │            resolved_name}                     │   ← resolved_name new
  │ ◀─────────────────────────────────────────── │
  │ C2S_AssetManifestRequest … (unchanged)        │
```

- `S2C_AuthChallenge.params` carries preset extras (`api_key`, `sign_in`
  methods) as a bounded string map; client never needs to parse `auth.lua`.
- `C2S_Auth.token` cap: 16 KiB (JWTs with group claims get large; still
  bounded). `player_name` is ignored under `External`; the name comes from
  `name_claim`.
- New server FSM state `kVerifyingAuth`: `authenticate` becomes
  `begin_authenticate(...) -> AuthTicket`; the session polls the ticket each
  tick (resolved immediately on the fast path where the key is cached).
  `auth_mode = none` keeps the synchronous path unchanged.
- Failure ⇒ `S2C_AuthResult{ok=false}` + `kAuthFailed` disconnect (existing
  code path). Reasons shown to the player are coarse ("sign-in expired",
  "not accepted by this server"); exact cause goes to the server log only.

### 5.3 Token verification (`vb::auth::TokenVerifier`)

Pure function over (config, key set, token, expected nonce, now). The rules:

1. Compact JWS, 3 base64url parts, header `alg` ∈ {`RS256`, `ES256`}
   allowlist (reject `none`, `HS*`, anything else); `kid` required.
2. Key by `kid` from cached JWKS; unknown `kid` ⇒ one rate-limited JWKS
   refresh (≥ 60 s apart), then fail.
3. Signature valid.
4. `iss` == configured issuer; `aud` (string or array) contains
   `client_id` (`project_id` for Firebase); if `azp` present it equals
   `client_id`.
5. `exp` > now − 60 s skew; `nbf`/`iat` ≤ now + 60 s; `now − iat` ≤
   `max_token_age_seconds` (bounds replay of refresh-derived tokens).
6. `nonce` claim == the challenge nonce **when the token came from an
   interactive browser sign-in** (OIDC presets put the server nonce into the
   authorization request). Firebase password sign-in and refresh-token
   re-use cannot carry it; for those, rule 5's freshness bound is the replay
   limit. See §8 for what this does and doesn't stop.
7. `sub` non-empty; `name_claim` present (fallback: `sub` prefix) and passes
   the existing player-name validation (1–32 bytes, sanitized).

Output `LoginInfo{provider, issuer, subject, name, claims (allowlisted,
JSON), issued_at, expires_at}`. The raw token is dropped immediately and
never logged or exposed to Lua. `issuer`/`issued_at`/`expires_at` are
engine-internal (identity keying, re-auth scheduling); Lua sees only the
user data (§6).

### 5.4 Dependencies (`VB_WITH_AUTH`, default ON for client+server)

- **HTTPS:** reuse the CLI's libcurl block (system TLS on each OS) — hoist it
  from `VB_BUILD_CLI`-only to `VB_BUILD_CLI OR VB_WITH_AUTH`.
- **Signature verify:** **Mbed TLS 3.6 LTS** via `vb_fetch` (Apache-2.0,
  builds everywhere, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 + ECDSA P-256). Rejected: OpenSSL
  (not shipped on Windows where curl uses Schannel; extra DLL),
  hand-rolled RSA (no). orlp/ed25519 stays CLI-only (no IdP signs with
  EdDSA by default).
- **JSON:** existing nlohmann_json.
- HTTP behind an injectable `vb::auth::HttpFetcher` interface so unit tests
  never touch the network.

### 5.5 Identity & names

- Engine keys identity by `(issuer, subject)`, never by name.
- Duplicate login (**decided 2026-10-05**): a second connection with an
  `(issuer, subject)` already in game **kicks the older session** ("signed
  in elsewhere") once the newcomer's verification succeeds. The newcomer is
  never refused, so a ghost session after a crash or network drop can't
  lock its owner out.
- Name collision between *different* subjects (two people called `alex`):
  the later one is shown as `alex#2`. Scripts must persist by
  `login.subject`, never by name (documented loudly).

### 5.6 Revocation: periodic live re-authentication

ID tokens are self-contained and can't be revoked after they're issued. The
IdP-side session behind them can be: a Keycloak admin logout, a disabled user,
a Firebase `revokeRefreshTokens` or a disabled account. The engine therefore
re-proves the login on a live connection on a timer, and a revoked
session fails at the next check.

```
Server                                         Client
  │ S2C_ReauthRequest{nonce, deadline_s}         │  every reauth_interval_seconds
  │ ───────────────────────────────────────────▶ │  (per-player jitter ±10%)
  │                                              │  silent: refresh-token grant
  │                                              │  at the IdP (no UI)
  │ C2S_Reauth{token}                            │
  │ ◀─────────────────────────────────────────── │
  │ verify (§5.3) + same (issuer, subject)       │
  │ + iat ≥ request_sent − skew                  │
```

- `auth.lua` keys: `reauth_interval_seconds` (default **900**, minimum 60;
  `0` disables, so a session is trusted until disconnect) and
  `reauth_grace_seconds` (default **120**).
- The refresh grant is the actual revocation check. A revoked session or
  disabled account makes the IdP refuse the refresh token, so no new ID
  token can be produced.
- If the silent refresh fails, the player keeps playing and sees a
  non-blocking in-game prompt: "Your sign-in expired. Sign in again". It
  opens the same browser or form flow, with the request's `nonce` applied.
  If no valid `C2S_Reauth` arrives before `deadline_s`, which is the grace
  period, the server kicks with `kAuthFailed` ("sign-in expired or
  revoked").
- Binding: refresh-derived ID tokens can't carry the nonce, so the server
  requires `iat` to be newer than the moment it sent the request (minus
  skew). An old token can't answer a new request. An interactive re-sign-in
  must also match the nonce.
- Subject change (a different account answering) ⇒ immediate kick.
- On success the session's `LoginInfo` is replaced. If any **allowlisted
  claim** changed (e.g. a group removed), the frozen table `get_login()`
  returns is swapped and `vb.on("login_changed", function(player, login))`
  fires, so packs can react, e.g. drop a moderator's powers. The in-game
  name stays fixed for the session; a changed `name_claim` takes effect on
  the next join.
- **Worst-case revocation latency = interval + grace** (default ≈ 17 min).
  Operators who need tighter revocation lower the interval. Instant push
  revocation (Keycloak back-channel logout, OAuth token introspection) needs
  an inbound HTTP endpoint or a confidential client on the game server. It is
  out of scope for this phase and listed in §13.
- Pack-side bans don't need this mechanism: a `player_join` veto keyed by
  `login.subject` keeps a banned account out at the next join.
- `--auth-token-file` (headless/automation) is re-read for each re-auth, so
  tests can rotate or withhold the token.

## 6. Lua surface (server pack VM)

| API | Returns |
| --- | --- |
| `player:get_login()` | `nil` when the server isn't authenticating, else a **frozen** table of user data only: `{ provider, subject, name, claims = {…allowlisted…} }` |
| `vb.on("player_join", function(name, login) … end)` | `login` same table or `nil`; `return false` still vetoes, *after* verification (e.g. allowlist by `login.claims.email_verified` or a group) |
| `vb.on("login_changed", function(player, login) … end)` | fires after a successful re-auth (§5.6) changed an allowlisted claim; notification only |
| `vb.auth.required()` | `true` iff `auth.lua` is active. Convenience; `get_login() ~= nil` gives the same answer per player |

Guarantee written into `docs/lua-api.md`: **when `auth.lua` is active,
`get_login()` is non-nil for every `Player` a script can ever obtain**.
No connection reaches `player_join_completed` without a verified login, so
scripts never need a "half-authenticated" branch.

**Lua stays high-level (decided 2026-10-05):** scripts see *who the player
is*, never how that was proven. Tokens, signatures, issuer URLs, expiry
times and the re-auth schedule are engine-internal and never reach any VM.
A pack that needs a field asks for it by adding the claim to `auth.lua`'s
`claims` list.

Client UI VM (`ui/*.lua`) gets `state.login = { name, subject }` (read-only,
own player only) for "Signed in as …" labels. No claims, no tokens.

## 7. Client side

- New `AppState::kSigningIn`, entered on `S2C_AuthChallenge`. The screen is
  engine-drawn raygui: `display_name`, the server address, provider host,
  buttons per sign-in method, Cancel. Cancel/timeout → `kError` with the
  reason (existing path).
- **Browser flow** (`vb::auth::OidcLoopbackFlow`): discovery → PKCE
  verifier/challenge (S256) + `state` + server `nonce` → listen on
  `127.0.0.1:<ephemeral>` → open system browser (`xdg-open` / `open` /
  `ShellExecuteW`) → receive `?code&state` → exchange at token endpoint →
  ID token. Runs on a worker thread; the render loop keeps drawing.
  Success page tells the player to return to the game.
- **Firebase password:** engine-drawn email/password form → Identity
  Toolkit REST → ID token. Password never touches the game server.
- **Session cache:** refresh token per `(issuer, client_id)` in
  `user_config_dir()/auth/<sha256(issuer|client_id)>.json`, mode 0600
  (OS keychain is a later step). Re-joining tries a silent refresh first;
  the token it yields carries no nonce, so it's accepted only within
  `max_token_age_seconds` (§5.3 rule 5). "Sign out" in the main menu deletes
  the cache entry.
- **First-use trust prompt:** first time a server address asks for a given
  issuer, show "*<server>* wants you to sign in with *<issuer host>*".
  Remembered per (server, issuer).
- **Headless/automation:** `--auth-token-file <path>` supplies a token
  directly (dev/CI; automation builds only); automation predicate gains
  `login.subject`.
- **Singleplayer** with an `auth.lua` pack: performs the same real sign-in
  (same handshake, one code path). No fake "local" login. A `nil` must always
  mean "no auth", so a pack never sees a synthetic login. Offline means you
  can't play that pack; `--insecure-skip-auth` exists for development.

## 8. Security notes

- **Fail closed everywhere** (§4). Server with `auth.lua` and no key set yet
  rejects joins with "authentication service unavailable".
- **Token forwarding by a malicious server.** A hostile server can claim
  any issuer/client_id in its challenge. If you sign in there, it can try
  to replay your ID token at the real server. Mitigations: the challenge
  nonce (the token only matches the connection whose nonce it carries,
  unless the hostile server relays that nonce in real time), the
  freshness bound, and the first-use prompt naming issuer and server. Full
  binding to the server's identity would need DPoP-style proof-of-possession
  and is out of scope. Recorded in the spec §17 table.
- GNS encrypts the transport, but with no server certificates it doesn't
  authenticate the server. Same root cause as the item above, and the same
  out-of-scope status.
- Revocation is periodic, not instant: worst case `reauth_interval_seconds
  + reauth_grace_seconds` (§5.6).
- Tokens never logged (log redaction test), never stored server-side, never
  exposed to Lua.
- Rate limit: auth attempts per IP (reuse `max_connections_per_ip` plumbing)
  + the existing handshake flood guard. `kVerifyingAuth` work is bounded:
  at most one in-flight JWKS refresh.
- JWT/JWKS parsers are fuzz targets (same policy as every `vb/protocol`
  decoder).

## 9. Code layout

```
inc/vb/auth/config.hpp        AuthConfig + load_auth_lua(pack_dir)
inc/vb/auth/jwt.hpp           JWS parse, base64url, claims
inc/vb/auth/jwks.hpp          KeySet, JwksCache (refresh, rate limit)
inc/vb/auth/verifier.hpp      TokenVerifier, LoginInfo
inc/vb/auth/http.hpp          HttpFetcher interface + curl impl
inc/vb/auth/oidc_client.hpp   client: discovery, PKCE, loopback flow
inc/vb/auth/firebase.hpp      client: Identity Toolkit password sign-in
src/auth/…                    vb_auth static lib (links vb_core, curl, mbedtls)
```

`vb_auth` is linked by the server, the client and the tests. Without
`VB_WITH_AUTH`, a stub lib keeps `load_auth_lua` working (so the
"refuse to start" check still runs) and has every verify/sign-in call fail.

## 10. Testing strategy

- **Unit (`vb_tests`):** `auth.lua` validation matrix; base64url/JWT parse
  edge cases; verifier rules 1–7 each with a failing token (test-only RSA and
  P-256 keys generated by Mbed TLS in-test, tokens signed in-test);
  JWKS cache refresh/rate limit via a fake `HttpFetcher`; handshake FSM
  with `kVerifyingAuth` pending/resolve/timeout; protocol round-trip + fuzz
  for the new/changed messages.
- **Integration:** `LoopbackTransport` server+client with a fake IdP
  (in-process `HttpFetcher` + signer): join succeeds, `get_login()` non-nil
  in `player_join` and later callbacks; no-`auth.lua` pack ⇒ `nil`
  everywhere; bad token ⇒ no `S2C_AssetManifest` ever sent (assert the world
  never loads).
- **E2E (pytest harness):** mock OIDC provider (small stdlib HTTP server with
  pre-generated key material checked into `tests/e2e/fixtures/`), client via
  `--auth-token-file` and via a scripted loopback redirect.
- **Manual:** real Keycloak (docker) and a real Firebase project, once per
  platform. Steps recorded in `docs/auth.md`.

## 11. Relationship to the 2026-09-17 direction (§18 Q6)

That note said the engine owns no auth concept and that packs build login
on `vb.db`. This design changes the first half: the engine now owns
**external, mandatory, declarative** authentication. That is exactly the
"future `auth_mode = oidc`" the note anticipated, with the mode chosen by
the pack (`auth.lua`) instead of `server.toml`. The second half stands. A pack
can still build its own `vb.db` login for its own purposes, but only
`get_login()` is engine-verified.

## 12. Phased plan

Each step is independently shippable and keeps `main` green. Sizes: S ≈ ≤1
day, M ≈ 2–3 days, L ≈ a week.

### 9.0 — Decision & docs (S)
- [ ] Update spec §18 Q6, §17 security table, `open-questions.md`,
      `architecture_spec/networking.md` handshake diagram to point here.
- **Exit:** docs agree; no code.

### 9.1 — `auth.lua` loading & fail-closed startup (S/M)
- [ ] `vb::auth::AuthConfig` + `load_auth_lua()`: minimal sandboxed VM,
      return-a-table contract, full validation, presets fill defaults.
- [ ] Pack loader and asset manifest skip `auth.lua`.
- [ ] `server.toml [auth]` overrides; `--insecure-skip-auth` (compiled out
      under `VB_DISTRIBUTION`); refuse to start when `VB_WITH_AUTH` is off.
- [ ] `content/base/auth.lua.example` (inactive by name), documented.
- **Exit:** malformed `auth.lua` ⇒ exit 1 with a clear message; valid one ⇒
  config logged (redacted); no `auth.lua` ⇒ unchanged behavior.

### 9.2 — Protocol v29 + handshake plumbing, stub verifier (M)
- [ ] `AuthMode::kExternal`; `S2C_AuthChallenge`; `S2C_AuthResult.resolved_name`;
      `C2S_Auth.token` 16 KiB cap; `S2C_ReauthRequest` / `C2S_Reauth`
      (wire format only here, used in 9.6); bump `kEngineProtocolVersion`;
      `docs/protocol.md` in lockstep.
- [ ] Server FSM `kVerifyingAuth` + `begin_authenticate`/ticket; per-state
      `auth_timeout_seconds`; client FSM handles the challenge
      (`ClientHandshakeConfig` gets an `obtain_token` callback).
- [ ] Round-trip + fuzz tests; FSM tests with a fake verifier.
- **Exit:** loopback join with fake verifier passes; rejected token ⇒ no
  asset manifest sent.

### 9.3 — Server token verification (L)
- [ ] `VB_WITH_AUTH`; hoist curl; add Mbed TLS 3.6 via `vb_fetch`.
- [ ] base64url/JWT parser, JWKS parse (RSA `n/e`, EC `x/y`), `JwksCache`
      with background refresh + rate limit, OIDC discovery, Firebase preset.
- [ ] `TokenVerifier` rules 1–7; `LoginInfo`; log redaction.
- [ ] Tests with in-test keys; fuzz targets for JWT/JWKS.
- **Exit:** every rule has a passing and a failing test; a real Keycloak
  token verifies in a manual run.

### 9.4 — Lua exposure (M)
- [ ] `LoginInfo` on the session; `player:get_login()` (frozen table / nil);
      `player_join(name, login)`; `vb.auth.required()`; `state.login` in
      the client UI VM.
- [ ] Name resolution from `name_claim`, collision suffixing, duplicate-
      subject kick.
- [ ] `docs/lua-api.md` with the non-nil guarantee; base-pack example
      script that branches on `login`.
- **Exit:** integration test: auth pack ⇒ non-nil in every callback that gets
  a `Player`; plain pack ⇒ nil.

### 9.5 — Client sign-in (L)
- [ ] `AppState::kSigningIn` screen; cancel/timeout → existing error path.
- [ ] `OidcLoopbackFlow` (PKCE S256, state, nonce, ephemeral 127.0.0.1
      listener, system-browser open per OS, token exchange) on a worker.
- [ ] Firebase password form + Identity Toolkit call; Firebase `google`
      via browser + `signInWithIdp`.
- [ ] `--auth-token-file` for headless/automation builds.
- **Exit:** manual sign-in against Keycloak and Firebase on Linux, macOS,
  Windows; headless join with a token file in CI.

### 9.6 — Sessions, re-auth & revocation (M/L)
- [ ] Refresh-token cache (0600), silent re-login, "Signed in as … / Sign
      out" in the main menu, first-use trust prompt.
- [ ] Periodic re-auth (§5.6): server scheduler with jitter,
      `reauth_interval_seconds`/`reauth_grace_seconds`, `iat` freshness +
      same-subject checks, kick on deadline; client silent refresh +
      non-blocking re-sign-in prompt.
- [ ] `LoginInfo` swap + `login_changed` event when allowlisted claims change.
- [ ] Tests: revoked refresh token (fake IdP refuses) ⇒ kick after grace;
      stale `iat` rejected; different subject ⇒ immediate kick; claim
      change fires `login_changed` once.
- **Exit:** second join within the refresh window opens no browser; a
  Keycloak admin logout kicks the player within interval + grace in a
  manual run.

### 9.7 — Singleplayer, `vb`, e2e (M)
- [ ] Singleplayer with an auth pack runs the real flow; `vb host` passes
      `[auth]` overrides through `server.toml`.
- [ ] Mock IdP + e2e tests (token-file path and scripted loopback redirect);
      automation predicate `login.subject`.
- **Exit:** `e2e` CTest covers auth-on and auth-off packs.

### 9.8 — Hardening (S/M)
- [ ] Per-IP auth rate limit; at most one in-flight JWKS refresh; security
      table rows; `docs/auth.md` operator guide (Keycloak client setup:
      public client, PKCE, redirect `http://127.0.0.1/*`; Firebase setup).
- [ ] Optional: OS keychain storage for refresh tokens.
- **Exit:** fuzzers run clean for a CI-length budget; operator guide lets a
  new operator stand up Keycloak auth from scratch.

## 13. Decisions & open questions

Decided 2026-10-05:

1. **Duplicate subject → kick the older session** (§5.5).
2. **Lua is high-level:** user data only (`provider`, `subject`, `name`,
   allowlisted `claims`). No tokens, issuer or expiry (§6).
3. **Revocation: yes**, via periodic live re-auth on by default
   (15 min + 2 min grace), with `login_changed` for claim updates (§5.6).

Still open:

4. **Instant revocation** (Keycloak back-channel logout or token
   introspection). It needs an inbound HTTP endpoint or a confidential client
   secret on the server. Revisit if operators find interval + grace too slow.
