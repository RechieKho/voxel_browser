- [x] **Real engine bug found 2026-09-28 while building
      `content/base/entities/zombie.lua` (Phase 6's "mob damage" item):
      a `script::PlayerHandle` stored across calls and read back from
      inside `vb.on("tick", ...)` or a script entity's own `on_tick`
      silently returns corrupted data** — confirmed with ASan (Windows
      MSVC + `clang_rt.asan_dynamic`, `-DVB_ENABLE_ASAN=ON`), not just
      inferred from a crash: `PlayerHandle::get_name()`/`get_pos()` read a
      garbage `rt` (`PackRuntime::Impl*`), a `nullptr`/garbage `session`,
      and a garbage `net_id` (observed `0xFFFFFFFE`) when called this way,
      instead of the real stored values. **Repro (minimal, reproduced
      multiple times with a guaranteed-fresh rebuild each time — see
      `content_pack_test.cpp`'s zombie test's own comment for the summary):**
      `vb.on("chat", function(player, text) stashed = player end)` then,
      from `vb.on("tick", function(dt) print(stashed:get_name()) end)`,
      the printed name is wrong/empty on every subsequent tick, forever —
      not a one-time race. **What's proven NOT the cause:** storage
      location (module-level global, entity-table field, and a bare Lua
      upvalue closure all reproduce it identically); it is not a same-tick
      timing race (reproduces across many ticks after the store, not just
      the first). **What IS the distinguishing factor:** reading a
      *stored* `PlayerHandle`'s methods from within the `dispatch_tick`
      call path (`PackRuntime::Impl::dispatch_tick` → `fire("tick", ...)`
      *or* → `dispatch_entity_tick` → a kind's `on_tick`) is broken;
      reading a **freshly passed-in** `PlayerHandle` argument from within
      *any* handler (`chat`, `player_input`, `player_join`, `player_death`,
      ...) — even storing *that* one and reading it back from a **later,
      separate `chat`/`player_input`-style dispatch** — works perfectly
      (also confirmed with ASan, `rt`/`session`/`net_id` all correct).
      `run_veto()` and `fire()` (`src/script/pack_runtime.cpp`) are
      structurally identical templates, so the bug isn't in either of
      those directly — it's somewhere in how `dispatch_tick` specifically
      reaches Lua (`ServerSession::on_script_tick_` → `PackRuntime::
      attach_session`'s hook lambda → `PackRuntime::dispatch_tick` →
      `Impl::dispatch_tick`), not yet root-caused further. **Worked
      around, not fixed:** `zombie.lua`'s own chase/attack logic is driven
      from `vb.on("player_input", ...)` instead (a fresh `PlayerHandle`
      every real `InputCmd`, used immediately, never stored) — see Phase
      6's own "mob damage" entry for the full design. **Impact if unfixed:**
      any *future* pack that tries the natural "capture a player in a
      hook, act on them later from `on_tick`" pattern will hit this
      silently (no crash in a non-ASan build — it just reads wrong data,
      e.g. `player:damage()` becomes a no-op since `session` reads as
      `nullptr`) — a real correctness trap for content authors, not just
      an inconvenience. Whoever picks this up next: start from the exact
      repro above (it's a ~15-line pack script), build `build-net-lua`
      with `-DVB_ENABLE_ASAN=ON` (needs `clang_rt.asan_dynamic-x86_64.dll`
      on `PATH`, found under the MSVC toolchain's `bin\Hostx64\x64`), and
      get a fresh ASan stack trace before theorizing — several plausible-
      sounding theories (GC collecting a live-referenced value, a `fire()`
      vs `run_veto()` implementation difference, a moved/stale
      `PackRuntime` pointer) were all checked and ruled out empirically
      during this investigation.
    - **2026-09-29 follow-up: reproduced end-to-end with a real ASan build
      (`-DVB_WITH_NET=OFF -DVB_WITH_LUA=ON -DVB_ENABLE_ASAN=ON`, plain
      `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo` — `VB_WITH_NET` can stay OFF for
      this repro since `LoopbackNetwork`/`ServerSession` don't need real
      GNS; a fresh `VB_WITH_NET=ON` configure on this box hits the
      pre-existing "Could NOT find Protobuf" gap noted in
      `STATE.md.local`).** Wrote a minimal `pack_runtime_integration_test.cpp`-
      style case: `vb.on("chat", ...)` stashes `player` into a Lua global on
      `text == "stash"`, `vb.on("tick", ...)` does
      `tick_name = stashed:get_name()` every tick, a later
      `vb.on("chat", ...)` on `text == "report"` returns `tick_name` so the
      C++ side can observe what the tick handler actually saw (chat's own
      dispatch path is the one proven unaffected, so it's a safe way to read
      the result out). Result: **not a silent bad-data read here — a real
      ASan-caught fault inside `PlayerHandle::get_name()` itself
      (`src/script/pack_runtime.cpp` — the `rt->session` dereference),
      every single time**, both as a plain `access-violation` (`rt` holding
      a small/near-null garbage value) and, in one run with extra
      `std::fprintf` debug args added inline, as a `stack-buffer-overflow`
      report pointing at `get_name()`'s own stack frame (with ASan's own
      "may be a false positive... setjmp/longjmp" hint attached, since
      Lua's C core (`ldo.c`) always uses raw `setjmp`/`longjmp` for
      `lua_pcall`'s protected-call boundary — `LUAI_TRY`/`LUAI_THROW` only
      switch to C++ `throw`/`catch` when the *including TU* is compiled as
      C++, which `ldo.c` never is). **Ruled out that longjmp/ASan
      interaction as the actual cause, though**: the fault reproduces
      identically with no `pcall` anywhere in the repro script (a bare
      `stashed:get_name()` inside `vb.on("tick", ...)`, no protected-call
      boundary below `fire()`'s own `sol::protected_function` at all) — same
      crash, same line, same "`rt` reads as garbage" shape. So this is a
      genuine memory bug, not an ASan/setjmp artifact; the "false positive"
      hint in one run's output was a red herring from that run's own added
      instrumentation, not a property of the underlying fault. **Not
      re-root-caused further** (this pass's budget went into getting a
      clean, deterministic, pcall-free repro plus a real ASan trace rather
      than a fix) — full sol2/call.hpp template chain from the trace:
      `fire<double&>` → `sol::basic_protected_function::call` → Lua calls
      into `sol::u_detail::binding<...>::call_with_` →
      `sol::call_detail::call_wrapped<PlayerHandle, ...>` →
      `lua_call_wrapper<PlayerHandle, std::string(PlayerHandle::*)()const,...>::call`
      → `stack::call_into_lua` → `stack::stack_detail::eval<0,
      argument_handler<...>&, ..., PlayerHandle&>` →
      `member_function_wrapper<...>::caller::operator()` → `get_name()`.
      Whoever picks this up next: don't re-derive the repro from scratch —
      the exact Lua snippet above plus that build command reproduces it in
      under a minute; step through `stack::stack_detail::eval`/
      `member_function_wrapper::caller` in a real debugger (cdb/WinDbg on
      this box) at the point it extracts `self` from the Lua stack for a
      *zero-argument* `const` member function returning `std::string` by
      value — that specific combination (no `sol::this_state`, no extra
      args, non-trivial return type) is the one thing every broken call site
      (`get_name()`, `get_pos()`) shares that the working ones (methods
      taking a fresh argument every call, e.g. `player_input`'s handle)
      don't obviously differ on at the Lua-script level, so the bug is most
      likely in how sol2 resolves `self` for exactly that call shape when
      the target function pointer is stored in a `sol::protected_function`
      invoked with a *single scalar argument unrelated to the stashed
      value* (`fire("tick", dt)` — `dt` alone) versus one invoked with the
      handle itself as a fresh argument. A fresh ASan run with a debugger
      attached (`cdb -g -G build-asan-repro\vb_tests.exe --test-case=...`)
      to catch the access-violation live and inspect the Lua stack slot at
      the crash point, rather than only reading the post-mortem trace,
      is the natural next step.
    - **2026-09-30: root-caused and fixed.** The 2026-09-29 "zero-argument
      const member function" theory was a red herring — confirmed by adding a
      second, structurally different repro (`vb.every(...)`'s timer, whose
      handler is called with **literally zero Lua arguments at all**, not
      just zero *scalar* args) alongside the original `vb.on("tick", ...)`
      one; both crashed identically, and a GC-stop experiment
      (`lua_gc(L, LUA_GCSTOP, 0)` right after opening libraries) did **not**
      prevent the crash, ruling out premature garbage collection of the
      userdata too. The real cause, found by temporarily instrumenting
      `PlayerHandle::get_name()` and `Impl::run_chat()` to print raw
      pointers: **the extracted `self` inside `get_name()` was byte-for-byte
      identical to `&p` of `run_chat()`'s own local `PlayerHandle p{...}`** —
      i.e. the Lua value being called wasn't a copy of the handle at all, it
      was a **raw pointer into `run_chat()`'s C++ stack frame**, already
      popped and reused by the time anything read it back. Cause: sol2
      (`stack_core.hpp`'s `stack_detail::push_reference<T>`) pushes a
      **non-const lvalue reference** to a registered usertype argument as
      `as_reference_tag` (a pointer into existing memory, no copy) by
      default — a documented perf optimization for the common case where a
      Lua handler only uses an argument during the call itself — unless the
      `SOL_FUNCTION_CALL_VALUE_SEMANTICS` config macro is defined on. Every
      dispatch call site in `pack_runtime.cpp` (`run_chat`, `run_player_input`,
      `run_respawn_handler`, `fire()`/`run_veto()`'s callers, ...) constructs
      a named local (`PlayerHandle p{...}`) and passes it straight into the
      Lua call — an lvalue every time — so any pack script that stores that
      argument beyond the call it was received in (a global, a table field,
      a closure upvalue — storage location never mattered, exactly as
      empirically found on 2026-09-28) ends up holding a dangling pointer
      into a stack frame that's already gone. It "worked" when read back from
      a *later, separate* `chat`/`player_input` dispatch purely by luck: that
      call path re-enters `run_chat`/`run_player_input` with the same C++
      call shape, so the next call's own `p` local happens to get allocated
      at the same stack address with correct-looking values; `dispatch_tick`'s
      entirely different call tree (`script_tick` phase vs. `network_io`
      phase in `ServerSession::build_systems()`) reuses that address for
      unrelated locals instead, producing the "always wrong from tick,
      always right from chat" split the original investigation correctly
      observed but explained one level too shallow. **Fix**
      (`cmake/Dependencies.cmake`, right after the `sol2` `vb_fetch()`
      call): `target_compile_definitions(sol2 INTERFACE
      SOL_FUNCTION_CALL_VALUE_SEMANTICS=1)` (resolved off the `sol2::sol2`
      alias via `ALIASED_TARGET`, since `target_compile_definitions()`
      rejects alias targets directly) — forces sol2 to push every
      registered-usertype function-call argument as an owned copy regardless
      of value category, restoring the invariant `PlayerHandle`'s own doc
      comment already assumed ("constructed fresh per dispatch call, so it
      can never dangle"). Applied to the sol2 target itself (not a
      `pack_runtime.cpp`-local `#define`) so it's consistent across every
      translation unit. Verified safe project-wide: `PlayerHandle` is the
      *only* usertype this project registers (`grep -n "new_usertype<"` across
      `src/script/`), and it's a stateless proxy — no method ever mutates
      `net_id`/`rt` in place — so forcing copy semantics changes nothing
      observable, only removes the unsafe aliasing. Confirmed with a
      permanent regression test (`pack_runtime_integration_test.cpp`, "a
      PlayerHandle stashed from a chat handler survives being read back from
      a later tick/timer handler") exercising both the `tick`-event and
      `vb.every` timer shapes. `content/base/entities/zombie.lua`'s
      `player_input`-driven workaround was left as-is (its comment updated to
      stop describing a now-fixed bug) — it never actually stored a
      `PlayerHandle` in the first place, only the zombie's own entity handle
      keyed by player name, so there was nothing to migrate. Verified: full
      `vb_tests` 425/425 green on `build-net-lua` (plain rebuild) and
      403/403 green on `build-asan-repro` (ASan on, exit 0 — no new leaks/UB),
      clean `-Werror` build of `vb_tests`/`voxel_browser`/
      `voxel_browser_server` (temporarily reconfigured `build-net-lua` with
      `-DVB_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=ON`, confirmed clean, reconfigured back to
      this dir's OFF default afterward).
- [x] Sanitizer (ASan/UBSan) debug CI job; TSan job for the threaded
      subsystems — landed 2026-09-28. `cmake/Sanitizers.cmake`'s
      `vb_sanitizers` INTERFACE target (and the `VB_ENABLE_ASAN`/
      `VB_ENABLE_UBSAN`/`VB_ENABLE_TSAN` options) already existed and were
      already linked into every first-party target, but no workflow ever
      turned them on — this closes that gap on the Linux matrix only
      (`.github/workflows/build_linux.yml`): two new `build_type` entries,
      `asan` (`-DVB_ENABLE_ASAN=ON -DVB_ENABLE_UBSAN=ON`, combinable per
      `Sanitizers.cmake`'s own mutual-exclusion check) and `tsan`
      (`-DVB_ENABLE_TSAN=ON`), both `RelWithDebInfo` so symbols/line info
      survive in sanitizer output. Both run the exact same `ctest
      --output-on-failure` the existing release/debug jobs already run — no
      new test list, the point is running *existing* tests under
      instrumentation. Binary staging/artifact upload is skipped for these
      two (`if: matrix.build_type == 'release' || matrix.build_type ==
      'debug'`) since a sanitizer build isn't a real distributable. Windows
      (MSVC) and macOS were deliberately left alone: `Sanitizers.cmake`
      itself already documents MSVC has no UBSan/TSan support at all (ASan
      only, and even that needed the `_DISABLE_*_ANNOTATION` workaround
      already in that file for third-party static-lib linking), and macOS CI
      doesn't even build `VB_WITH_NET` yet (Phase 1's own still-open item)
      — Linux is the one platform where all three sanitizers and the
      full net-enabled build are simultaneously supported. **Not verified by
      an actual GitHub Actions run** — this agent environment has no way to
      trigger/observe a real Actions run; the change is a straightforward
      extension of the existing, already-green release/debug matrix entries
      (same install/configure/build/test steps, just extra `-DVB_ENABLE_*`
      flags plumbed through `matrix.sanitizer_cmake_flags`), but the first
      real run may still surface a genuine sanitizer finding (a real race or
      UB) or an environment quirk (e.g. a third-party FetchContent'd lib not
      tolerating being linked against instrumented code) that a local
      Windows-only agent session can't preempt — same category of caveat as
      every GUI-adjacent item in this file, just for CI infrastructure
      instead of rendering.
- [x] Soak test target (N simulated clients, random walk + edits) — landed
      2026-09-28 as `tests/unit/soak_test.cpp`, folded into the normal
      `vb_tests` run rather than a separate nightly/pre-release job. 4
      simulated `ClientSession`s over `LoopbackNetwork` (real `ServerSession`
      + `WorldReplicator` + `World`, `WorldGenWorkerPool::kSynchronous`)
      random-walk (fixed-seed `std::mt19937`, reproducible) and
      break/place-edit for 150 ticks, then all disconnect. Asserts three
      things ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md's Testing Strategy calls out: every client
      stays joined and no pending connection is left stuck
      (`player_count()`/`pending_count()`), `pending_edit_count()`/
      `unacked_input_count()` stay bounded rather than growing across the
      whole run (a real queue-growth bug — an ack that stops being sent, an
      edit result that never arrives — would blow well past the generous
      bound), and `World::loaded_coords()` stays bounded rather than growing
      roughly linearly with tick count (chunk unload actually keeps working
      under sustained random-walk churn). A final round confirms
      `player_count()`/`pending_count()` both return to 0 after every client
      disconnects — no leaked `Conn` entry. Real ASan/LSan leak detection
      comes for free from this simply being part of `vb_tests`, which the
      Linux CI matrix already runs under `-DVB_ENABLE_ASAN` (this same day's
      earlier CI pass) — no separate sanitizer wiring needed for that half.
      **Deliberately kept small** (4 clients, close together, 150 ticks):
      real fBm terrain generation dominates this test's cost in an
      unoptimized Debug build far more than the sim logic actually being
      soaked — an earlier draft (6 clients spread far enough apart to force
      a distinct set of chunk columns each, 400 ticks) measured ~55s of real
      CPU time standalone; this version measured ~14s against a ~70s
      baseline for the other 412 tests combined, a proportionate addition
      rather than a suite-doubling one. Verified: full `vb_tests` 413/413
      green, clean `-Werror` build of `vb_tests`/`voxel_browser`/
      `voxel_browser_server`.
- [x] Perf budget checks: chunk mesh time, snapshot size — landed 2026-09-28
      as `tests/unit/perf_budget_test.cpp`, two budget-gate `TEST_CASE`s
      folded into the normal `vb_tests` run (no historical tracking, no
      graphs, nothing scheduled separately — matching this item's own
      "simple benchmark harness" framing). Chunk mesh time: generates a
      real chunk at the generator's own reported surface height (a fixed
      chunk-y guess turned out unreliable — an earlier draft hit an entirely
      open-sky chunk for this seed/column and failed its own "not empty"
      sanity check), meshes it 3x via `mesh_chunk()` and keeps the fastest
      run, asserts `< 100ms` (measured ~21ms in this environment's
      unoptimized Debug build — real headroom, not a hair's-width pass).
      Snapshot size: encodes a 50-entity `S2CEntitySnapshot` (deliberately
      busier than any single player's interest radius would realistically
      ever surface at once) and asserts the encoded size stays under a
      per-entity byte budget (measured ~52 bytes/entity; budget is 90
      bytes/entity + a fixed 256-byte allowance) — would catch a real
      regression such as `visual_override` starting to ride on every
      record instead of only `entered` ones. **Frame time was deliberately
      left out**, not attempted as a stand-in: real rasterization/GPU cost
      needs a live GL context to mean anything, and this agent environment
      has no GUI. Verified: full `vb_tests` 415/415 green (2 new cases),
      clean `-Werror` build of `vb_tests`/`voxel_browser`/
      `voxel_browser_server`.
