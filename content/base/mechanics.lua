-- REMAINING_TASKS.md 6.17/6.18: combat used to be Minecraft-style
-- hold-to-break (a fixed 0.35s LMB-hold timer, 100% hardcoded C++, no pack
-- involvement, and no way to hit another player at all). The engine now has
-- zero built-in "holding a button does X" behavior -- src/client/main.cpp
-- only ever reports raw, level-triggered button state (input.buttons.primary
-- = "LMB is down right now", every tick, exactly like buttons.jump/sprint);
-- this file turns the *rising edge* of that into one discrete punch via
-- player:punch(), and the engine decides what the punch actually hit.
--
-- player:punch() (Phase 6.18, src/net/session.cpp's ServerSession::punch())
-- raycasts blocks and nearby players along this player's own authoritative
-- look direction and resolves to whichever is closer -- a block accumulates
-- one hit against BlockType::max_damage (0 = breaks on the first punch,
-- same as every pre-6.18 block); a player takes vb.combat.set_params's
-- default PvP damage. Neither of those policies lives here -- this file's
-- only job is deciding *when* a punch happens (once per click, not once per
-- tick a mouse button happens to still be down).

-- Per-player "was primary/secondary already down last tick" edge state,
-- keyed by player name -- same convention content/examples/kitchen_sink/
-- keybinds.lua already uses (input.keybinds/buttons are level-triggered;
-- PlayerHandle is a fresh wrapper object every call, not a stable table key,
-- so a NetId-or-name string is the only stable thing to index by).
local was_down = {}
local was_secondary_down = {}

-- REMAINING_TASKS.md 6.20: right-click placing used to be the one remaining
-- hardcoded block edit -- src/client/main.cpp sent a C2S_BlockEdit{kPlace}
-- directly off MOUSE_BUTTON_RIGHT with a hardcoded stone block, no pack seam
-- at all (6.17's own writeup flagged this: "Placing (RMB, always instant) is
-- unaffected"). This closes that gap the same way 6.18 closed it for
-- breaking/punching: the client only reports raw input.buttons.secondary,
-- this handler decides *when* (rising edge) and *what* via
-- player:place_block(), and the engine only ever runs the validated edit
-- primitive (apply_script_block_edit -- reach check, hooks, fan-out), same
-- as break_block().
--
-- Entity-management follow-up (REMAINING_TASKS' "held item / hotbar
-- selection" gap): "what" used to be a hardcoded base_stone_id regardless of
-- what the player was even carrying. Now reads player:get_held_item() (the
-- new selected-slot primitive, Phase 6.20) -- an empty/out-of-range slot
-- places nothing at all, and a successful placement spends one unit of the
-- held stack via player:take() the same way crafting already spends
-- ingredients, so placing is a real inventory drain now instead of an
-- infinite stone dispenser.
