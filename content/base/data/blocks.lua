-- content/base's block data: pure data, no `vb.*` calls (see
-- docs/structure-editor.md §G). Registered by blocks/register.lua; the
-- structure editor reads this same file to build its palette.
--
-- ORDER MATTERS: block ids are assigned in registration order and saved
-- worlds store ids. This is the order the old per-block files registered in
-- (sorted blocks/*.lua). base:stone, dirt, grass, sand, water, wood and
-- leaves already hold fixed ids from BlockRegistry::base() (src/world/block.cpp)
-- -- registering them again by name is idempotent and only attaches the extra
-- fields (texture, replaceable); planks and sticks are the new ids.
--
-- `drops` is read by blocks/register.lua, not the engine: the block that
-- spawns when this one breaks (default: itself). `drops = false` attaches no
-- on_break at all (water). `texture` is a pack-relative path synced to the
-- client over Asset Sync and packed into its texture atlas.
