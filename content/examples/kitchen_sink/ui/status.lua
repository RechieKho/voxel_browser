-- kitchen_sink:status -- opened by keybinds.lua's player_input handler via
-- `player:open_ui("kitchen_sink:status", {})` (Phase 6.2/6.3, spec §10.4).
-- Loaded client-side only, over Asset Sync for a real connection or straight
-- off disk for --singleplayer (docs/lua-api.md's "Client wiring" note) --
-- never by src/script/pack_loader.cpp, which only ever sees this pack's
-- server-side files (blocks/entities/biomes/root *.lua/init.lua).
--
-- `render(state)` (Phase 6.2) runs once per UI frame while this screen is
-- open; `state` persists across those frames (seeded once from `open()`'s
-- ctx_json, `{}` here since keybinds.lua passes an empty context table).
